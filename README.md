# hs2-aem-commons

This project is a repository of individual AEM packages freely distributed by HS2 Solutions, Inc to help AEM developers
work around bugs, implement new features, and otherwise just "Get Sh*t Done!"

## Features

### hotfix-msm-lockable-deep-properties
This is a hotfix to address a documented AEM OOTB limitation where MSM does not operate with deep properties in regards
to using the cq-msm-lockable attribute to disable inheritance when configuring MSM locks on page properties
(cq:propertyInheritanceCancelled).
